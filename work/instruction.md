Follow these steps exactly:

1) Copy the example scene into a working file:
   - Read `examples/scene_example.json`
   - Write it to `scene.json` in the sandbox (same folder you will run python from)

2) Run:
   - `python engine/run.py scene.json out.scad`

3) Return `out.scad` as a downloadable file. Do not paste SCAD inline.

# Specification Template (Prototype)

## Instructions to AI
- Read `docs/bundle.md`
- Produce `scene.json` that conforms to `schemas/scene.schema.json`
- If ambiguous, ask questions and propose a spec patch.


## Objects
(Describe objects.)

## Note
spec_sample is what we originally started with where the LLM tried to do 
everything.  It will need to evolve into something without all of the global 
rules
